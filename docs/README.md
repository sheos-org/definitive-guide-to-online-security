# You ARE a target

If you are reading this memo, it‚Äôs probably either because you‚Äôve asked for it,
or someone has deliberately sent it to you.

This means you recognize you are a target. Don‚Äôt forget that. It‚Äôs super easy to
become complacent and that leads to STUPID errors.

This is a memo to highlight best security practices. It‚Äôs a practice because
it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúone-and-done‚Äù thing you do - just like installing a lock on your
door, it only works if you USE the lock and lock the door.

This is a living document, but it is only meant as guidance and may quickly
become obsolete.

The goal here is to make it harder for attackers to gain access to your
information and money and identity.

This is also written for the *average* user. If you think you are a high-risk
target. Please seek expert advice! I can make some recommendations for you.

### 1.  Physical Security

##### 1.1.  Never leave your devices unattended

Please ensure your devices are either LOCKED away or on your person. DO NOT
leave laptops in a bag in the corner of a conference room / meetup / bar.

##### 1.2.  Activate remote wiping

Use FindMyiPhone or equivalent so that if you lose your device you can (a) see where it is and (b) remote wipe the data:  Settings > Accounts & Passwords > iCloud > Find My iPhone.

* If you have remote wiping enabled and someone gains access to your iCloud, then they will be able to wipe your devices remotely. Please make sure your iCloud is secured correctly and not attached to your cell phone number! 

##### 1.3.  Who can see your devices?

I once sat on a plane next to a competitor in an M&A deal. By the end of the
flight I knew exactly what they were going to pay for the business we were
competing to buy. I won the deal. üòÇ

Be careful when using your laptop or making phone calls in public places. Use a
[privacy
screen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07CJPPCC3/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
for your laptop.

##### 1.4.  External drives

DO NOT plug external drives into your computer. If someone needs to share a
document with you, ask them to do so through google drives. If there is no
alternative, use YOUR USB stick which you should wipe each time you use it.

USB sticks make great giveaways at conferences. (NOT!). Never put a giveaway USB
drive into your computer!!

##### 1.5.  Sharing your screen

If you are sharing your screen in a webinar / conference call or at a conference
venue by plugging into a projector remember that whatever is on your screen is
visible to others.

Close unnecessary applications / tabs / browsers and switch off alerts  (*I
recently saw a tinder alert on the big screen from someone‚Äôs laptop at a
conference!* üòÇ)

##### 1.6.  Video streams

We all regularly use video streams to have conversations with friends and
colleagues around the world. When you are not using your camera - use a [camera
cover](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Webcam-Privacy-Cover-TechPrivacy-Logo-less/dp/B075VYMPHW/ref=sr_1_5?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1528198754&sr=1-5&keywords=laptop+camera+cover).
Also helpful incase an audio call unexpectedly becomes a video call!

When you are using your camera think about what is on display. Not just you but
are there any papers, notes, other screens, whiteboards, background
conversations which you don‚Äôt want to be streamed too!

##### 1.7.  Paper security

Avoid using paper to write down important information unless is secured. A lost notebook cannot be remotely wiped.

##### 1.8.  Location

Avoid posting on social media about your travel plans. Particularly if your house is empty when you‚Äôre away.


### 2.  Digital Security

##### 2.1.  Keep your software up-to-date

Fully reboot your laptop at least twice a week and perform a check for software updates. The eternally ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù Macbook is prone to miss updates and
compromise security. Ensure full disk-encryption is switched ON.

##### 2.2.  Phone

-   You should use an iPhone, model SE or later. Android phones are not safe to
    use.

-   Your iPhone is the most secure device you have. Do whatever work you can on
    it. It is always better to read email, use Signal, and surf the web on your
    phone.

-   Make sure you have at least a six digit key code or passphrase.

-   TouchID is safe to use, but Siri is not. Siri can reveal information about
    your contacts even when the phone is locked. Set timed locks!

-   Make sure your settings are restrictive when the screen is locked -
    *Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Passcode Lock*

##### 2.3.  SIM Safety

-   Sim Jacking is increasingly dangerous. This is where someone is able to
    arrange a ‚Äúswap‚Äù of your phone service into their own SIM by social
    engineering. Now, your calls and texts on your phone will no longer go to
    you, but to them. They normally time this while you are sleeping or
    traveling so that you will not realize for a few hours (or days).

-   You can protect yourself by using a private number (unknown to others, not
    used for any communications). You can get one on Google Voice, OnSIP,
    DINGTONE, FreedomPop. Do not connect this to forward to your existing phone
    number or that will defeat the purpose.

##### 2.4.  Computer

A mac is preferable to a windows computer which tend to be more susceptible to
attacks.

##### 2.5.  Passwords

-   Never use the same password twice.

-   Always use a password manager to create (randomly generate) and share
    passwords. Recommended length is at least 20 characters.

-   Only share passwords when absolutely necessary - it is preferable to have
    multiple accounts.

-   [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) or [1password](https://1password.com/)
    are my recommended password managers.

-   ‚ÄúRemember Me‚Äù buttons are best avoided!

##### 2.6.  2FA

2FA = *something you know (password) *+ *something you have (codes)*

* Add 2-step verification (2-factor authentication) to your high value accounts: [LastPass, Google, Mailchimp, Telegram, LinkedIn, Twitter] etc. Basically anything that can be used to steal company information or impersonate you. After you have set up 2FA wipe all current logins so that you know they are protected.

* For 2FA use a combination of

    * ____FIDO____
        * [Yubikey](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-YubiKey-USB-Authentication-Security/dp/B018Y1Q71M)
            * I recommend having 2 yubikeys - one that you keep with you and one kept in a safe.
        * [Google Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key/) - an alternative to Yubikey

    * 2FA App
        * [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator)
        * Authy

    * Backup codes 
        * I recommend writing these on a piece of paper and storing in a safe or storing in encrypted disk images on cloud drives.

    * DO NOT USE YOUR MOBILE NUMBER  mobile numbers are easily stolen (see "2.3 SIM Safety")

![](https://i.imgur.com/1tu0V7Z.png)

*It is a bad idea to write down your passwords and chain your 2FA device to your
computer!!*

##### 2.7.  Team drives

All company information should be stored in the Team Drives. Please avoid saving
company information on your personal computer or personal drives.

##### 2.8.  Attachments

Attachments are one of the biggest risks you face. Even attachments coming from
a trusted sender are a danger; if someone you know gets their email hacked, the
attacker may send you a message that looks just like a typical message (for
example, an email from your colleague with a Word doc).

Here is the hierarchy of attachment safety, from safest to most risky:

-   Safest is to open them on an iPhone.

-   Save them directly to Google Drive from Gmail. If you hover over an
    attachment in Gmail, you'll see a 'save in Google Drive' icon.

-   Download them to disk, and upload them to Google Drive in your browser. Make
    sure you delete the downloaded file, so you don't accidentally double-click
    it in the future.

-   The least safe way to open an attachment is to double-click it on your
    laptop. Never do this.

Don‚Äôt send attachments. Send google drive links wherever possible.

##### 2.9.  Links

Shortened URL links can make you visit websites that are BAD news. If in doubt,
copy the shortened url, and then open up terminal and type "curl URL -I" which
will then show the URL that the link shortener goes to, without having to
actually go there.

##### 2.10.  Browsers

-   Use Google Chrome as your default browser on your laptop.

-   Avoid Safari and Firefox. Under no circumstances use the Tor browser (it's
    okay to use Tor, but do it with Chrome, and seek additional training on how
    to set it up).

-   On your iPhone, it's okay to use Safari.

-   Use the uBlock Origin and HTTPS Everywhere Chrome browser extensions.

-   Avoid using other extensions.

##### 2.11.  Wifi

Where possible connect to wifi networks you trust. For unsecure networks, avoid
carrying out sensitive tasks and sending and receiving sensitive information.

Unsecure wifi includes:
   
-   Conferences

-   Cafes / public places

-   Airports

-   Aeroplanes

If in doubt, hotspot to your mobile phone.

##### 2.12.  Messaging apps

| Good for secure conversations | Okay for normal use | NOT Okay           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Sense Chat                    | Whatsapp            | Facebook Messenger |
| Signal                        | Slack               | Twitter DMs        |
| Telegram private chat         | Skype               | Instagram DMs      |
| Wikr                          | WeCha               | SMS                |

##### 2.13.  Credit Cards

Do your best to protect the privacy of your credit card numbers. If you want to
use virtual cards to give out to people who shop, work, or do errands for you, I
recommend using [Privacy.com](https://privacy.com/join/B53YC) - you can use this
service to create custom cards for individual merchants or people, in addition,
you can set limits on monthly spending or create a card for one-time use. I
recommend using these for services online that require you to put your card down
for a free trial, or for any subscription so you have a single place where you
can turn off a subscription by just pausing your virtual credit card.

##### 2.14.  Financial Information

Try to avoid putting your credit cards or account numbers into an email or into
unencrypted notes on your computer or cloud storage (this includes iCloud/Apple
notes). Definitely avoid storing your pin number near your ATM or debit card. I
recommend avoiding writing these sort of things down. As tempting as it is to
put them in your wallet in little pieces of paper, it‚Äôs probably the least
secure place and easiest to be stolen/lost since you carry it around.

### 3.  Cryptocurrency Security

[This](https://hackernoon.com/eight-simple-rules-for-protecting-your-cryptocurrency-5cdddc9f674d)
is the best article I have found for keeping your crypto. It is also long and
complex and isn‚Äôt for the everyday user. The steps you take should be
proportionate to the amount of crypto you hold and your appetite for risk vs.
security.

Below is a short guide to what I would consider to be *reasonable* steps.

##### 3.1.  Exchanges

-   Do a quick google check before you use an exchange EVERY time. Exchanges are
    constantly subject to attack. Even an exchange you‚Äôve used for years might
    become compromised. It‚Äôs worth a quick check each time you use it / log in.

-   Don‚Äôt broadcast which exchanges you use!

-   Use a private browser for exchanges

-   When using an exchange close any browsers that are unnecessary

-   Get KYC‚Äôd on a few different exchanges so that you have flexibility incase
    one goes down

###### 3.1.1.  Emails / usernames

When signing up for exchanges use an email address which is only used for this
purpose and preferably one which is uncorrelated to you so that people can‚Äôt
guess an email address for you. E.g. <x84ha56fkes0983@gmail.com>. Make sure
there is 2FA on this email address.

Use a username that is also uncorrelated to you e.g. x84ha56fkes0983.

###### 3.1.2.  2FA

Make sure there is 2FA on your exchange accounts wherever possible. As above,
your phone is **NOT** a secure 2FA mechanism.

###### 3.1.3.  Don‚Äôt keep funds on exchanges

Do not use an exchange as a place for storing your cryptocurrency. If the
exchange has a problem YOU will have a problem.

Try to minimize the amount of time that you have funds (both fiat and crypto)
kept in an exchange.

##### 3.2.  Storage

 *If you don‚Äôt own your private keys, you don‚Äôt have control of your crypto!*

 *Diversify. Holding everything you have in one wallet is NOT smart.*

There are many types of wallet. And tonnes of online resources to help you
choose. Divide in terms of when you will need to exchange or spend crypto. Keep
a small amount of crypto on [hot
wallets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YM7hjtKHxA0Qh6yxk57FhKR4LTXoOgMibDJESQ4luA/edit?fbclid=IwAR2CPhzpcmI7tNXEy0J9Sr_01Nwhcpnp4xSxrWwmvZqi85NLHsXAZtSS_rM#heading=h.7aot6wlhpvi1)
incase you want to send some to someone or buy something. For currency you are
**HODLing**, use [cold
wallets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YM7hjtKHxA0Qh6yxk57FhKR4LTXoOgMibDJESQ4luA/edit?fbclid=IwAR2CPhzpcmI7tNXEy0J9Sr_01Nwhcpnp4xSxrWwmvZqi85NLHsXAZtSS_rM#heading=h.acwh0mb3h4c3).

###### 3.2.1.  Backing up your wallet

You don‚Äôt need a lot of room to store backups of your wallets. Get a couple of
memory sticks (16GB is fine). Memory sticks are not a high margin business -
expect them to fail. Never back up to just one external disk and consider it
done. Use encryption on your disks.

Again, make sure that you are keeping at least one backup FAR AWAY from the
others. Having all your backups in your sock drawer isn‚Äôt helpful when your
house burns down.

###### 3.2.2.  Backing up Seed phrases

Some wallets are created from 12-20 word seed phrases. Seed phrases are great
because if you lose everything else you can restore your wallet! They can also
be really bad - if someone gets hold of your seed phrase they can STEAL YOUR
CRYPTO!

-   **Option 1** - Write down two copies of your wallet recovery phrases (using
    pen and paper). Keep them in safe places far apart from each other. For
    example - one in a bank deposit box and one buried in the garden (lol). Do
    **not** write the public key of the wallet on these pieces of paper. Come up
    with some sort of code so you can identify which seed phrase belongs to
    which wallet. Hopefully you never need these. Do **not** keep these in the
    same place as your hardware wallet.

-   **Option 2** - If you are adverse to paper (for instance, due to it‚Äôs being
    flimsy and flammable), you can use encrypted drives. If you don‚Äôt know how
    to use encrypted drives to store things, then ask a friend who is
    technically inclined - or go back to paper.

###### 3.2.3.  Hot wallets

Hot wallets are connected to the internet. These are easier to use but higher
risk than cold storage. Use them for small amounts of crypto. *(unless you‚Äôre
day trading in which case you shouldn‚Äôt need this memo)*.

Tips for using hot wallets:

-   Close all unnecessary applications especially anything which is connected to
    the internet. E.g. browsers.

-   Only use a hot wallet on a secure internet connection.

###### 2.3.1.  Mobile wallets

Mobile wallets are wallets that are stored on your mobile phone. They are a
terrible idea for anything more than a few dollars worth of crypto. If you don‚Äôt
already check your phone thirty times a day, you will when it also stores your
money!

###### 2.3.2.  Desktop wallets

Desktop wallets are a great solution to a small amount of crypto that you want
easy access to.

-   [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home) is a system of decentralized servers
    it started for bitcoin but is now the basis for a number of great wallets
    that also hold other coins. [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/) and
    [Jaxx](https://jaxx.io/) for example have great UIs. They are created from
    pre-determined [seed
    phrases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YM7hjtKHxA0Qh6yxk57FhKR4LTXoOgMibDJESQ4luA/edit?fbclid=IwAR2CPhzpcmI7tNXEy0J9Sr_01Nwhcpnp4xSxrWwmvZqi85NLHsXAZtSS_rM#heading=h.841rd56115hy)
    which you will need to store correctly.

-   [MEW](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) is another popular way to generate
    wallets. You can also access a MEW wallet through
    [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) which has many integrations with dApps and
    is helpful to store a small amount of crypto that you want to use
    frequently.

-   When using one of these wallets always make sure to [back-up your
    keys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YM7hjtKHxA0Qh6yxk57FhKR4LTXoOgMibDJESQ4luA/edit?fbclid=IwAR2CPhzpcmI7tNXEy0J9Sr_01Nwhcpnp4xSxrWwmvZqi85NLHsXAZtSS_rM#heading=h.dtf400817y57).

-   For EOS - The [eos-voter](https://github.com/greymass/eos-voter) wallet by
    Greymass is the best. Also, make sure your tokens are staked. You can
    monitor your account using the [EOS Authority
    tool](https://eosauthority.com/alerts).

###### 3.2.4.  Cold wallets

![](https://i.imgur.com/Rbz4Z0B.png)

Cold wallets **never** touch the internet. They are best for coins you want to
HODL.

###### 2.4.1.  Hardware wallet.

-   A hardware wallet is a piece of hardware, like the [Ledger Nano
    S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s) or
    [Trezor,](https://trezor.io/) that you buy and it stores your private keys.
    Think about [physical
    security](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YM7hjtKHxA0Qh6yxk57FhKR4LTXoOgMibDJESQ4luA/edit?fbclid=IwAR2CPhzpcmI7tNXEy0J9Sr_01Nwhcpnp4xSxrWwmvZqi85NLHsXAZtSS_rM#heading=h.8hsx6uavgkky)
    for your hardware wallet.

-   Trezor supports a 25th seed word that you can add for extra protection.

###### 2.4.2.  Cold Storage Computer

-   You may wish to use a computer that is [air
    gapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking))  *has never been
    connected to the internet)* to store your wallet. Think about [physical
    security](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YM7hjtKHxA0Qh6yxk57FhKR4LTXoOgMibDJESQ4luA/edit?fbclid=IwAR2CPhzpcmI7tNXEy0J9Sr_01Nwhcpnp4xSxrWwmvZqi85NLHsXAZtSS_rM#heading=h.8hsx6uavgkky)
    for your air-gapped computer.

###### 2.4.3.  Paper wallet

-   This is super secure (provided you set it up correctly) but also hardcore
    and should be used for people who have a very safe place to store a piece of
    paper (think flooding, fire and deliberate attempts to damage). See this
    guide from blockgeeks for more info:
    <https://blockgeeks.com/guides/paper-wallet-guide/>

-   Do not take a photo of your paper wallet with your phone or computer or with
    a digital camera, or with any camera ideally.

###### 3.2.5.  Multi-sig

-   Many protocols allow you to set up multi-signature wallets. This means that
    an account can be protected by multiple account signatures in order to
    execute any action.

-   Have you ever seen a war movie where they have to turn two keys to detonate
    a nuclear weapon? Every transaction on a multisig account works like that.
    There are many wallets and blockchains that support multisig accounts
    including Ethereum, EOS, and Bitcoin.

-   Electrum - [http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/multisig.html](http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/multisig.html)

-   Gnosis - [https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet](https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet)

### 4.  Conclusion

###### 4.1.1.  Security is a way of life.

-   Choose what will work for you and create systems you will follow, then
    expire those systems at some point and come up with new ones. Have fun with
    your security!

###### 4.1.2.  The conclusion of life.

-   Please think about what happens if something happens to YOU. Does a family
    member or lawyer or friend (or a combination of these) know how they would
    go about getting your crypto if something happened to you? Do you have an
    [emergency access vault](https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/emergency-access) or
    something similar?
